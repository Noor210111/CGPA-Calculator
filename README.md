After runnig the project, there will appear three options - <br>
1. SGPA (for calculating Semester GPA) <br>
2. YGPA (for calculating Yearly GPA) <br>
3. CGPA (for calculating Cumulative GPA) <br> <br>

If 1 is selected from 1-3, there will appear eight options (1-8) for eight semesters. One has to select his/her desired semester and all the courses name with course code and credit will appear. One has to just input marks for those course and it will calculate the result. <br> <br>

Same approach for both the YGPA and CGPA.
